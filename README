nuskybgd is code for simulating the NuSTAR background the Cosmix X-ray Background (CXB). It
simulates the X-rays that are focued throught the optic as well the "stray light" from the
CXB that leaks in around the optics bench and through the aperture stop.

In /docs there is a detailed documentation and walk through. Please read this first before
attempting to use this software.

This code was written by Dan Wik, and was originally described in the appendix of the paper here:
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1403.2722

If you use nuskbygd, please reference this paper.

This code is offered "as is" for the user. Users should be warned that using nuskbygd
occasionally requires some tweaking of the scripts to work for specific cases.

Please also note that nuskbygd relies (heavily) on the AstroLib and is not intended as a
standalone repository. Please check out the entire nustar-idl repo if you want to use nuskbygd.
